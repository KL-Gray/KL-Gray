- 👋 Hi, I’m @KL-Gray, otherwise known as Kelly Gray.
- 👀 I started learning programming in high school in the late 1970s. In 1978, I taught myself assembly language programming on a friend's Commodore PET.
- 🌱 My actual training is in electronics, with a strong interest in embedded microcontrollers.
- 💞️ I have a number of retro computer projects on the go. Those are mostly single board computer systems using mostly vintage computer hardware and operating systems, with the occasional modern component in the system to make it more capable, or simply easier to build. Those include an Intel 8085 based computer, a Z180 based computer, and a repurposed industrial control computer. All will evenutally be running the CP/M operating system.

- 📫 The easiest way to reach me is probably by email. kelly61<dot>gray<at>gmail<dot>com

- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not sitting in front of a computer or holding a soldering iron, I'm usually outside taking long walks. I've averaged about 10Km of walking every day since the start of 2020.
